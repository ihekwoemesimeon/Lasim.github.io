      The FIFA Club World Cup has undergone a revolutionary transformation in
      2025, growing from a niche tournament into one of the biggest spectacles
      in global football. With 32 of the world’s best clubs battling it out in
      the United States, this expanded edition mirrors the traditional FIFA
      World Cup format and marks a major shift in the football landscape.

    <p>
      Previously an annual, seven-team event held each December, the FIFA Club
      World Cup often flew under the radar. But FIFA's 2025 overhaul has changed
      everything. Held every four years, this new format brings together 32
      clubs from across all six footballing confederations, showcasing champions
      and top performers from Europe, South America, Africa, Asia, and beyond.
      According to FIFA, the aim is to “create a global club competition that
      matches the prestige of the national team World Cup.”
